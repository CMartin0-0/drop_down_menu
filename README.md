This is a small Drop Down Menu react component. 

It is setup with minimal styling, and will map out buttons based on an array passed to it. The array should be passed as a buttons prop and the default format is: [{label: "insert buttons label", onClick: "insert an onClick function"}].
It supports one other toggleLabel prop, for the toggle button that collapses and expands the drop down. See the code itself for an example of what a basic implementation would look like. To just use the drop down menu, copy the DropDownMenu.tsx and DropDownMenu.css files into your project and then you can use them as you like (for example how they are used in this repo).
