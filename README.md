This is a small Drop Down Menu component. 

It is setup with minimal styling, and will map out buttons based on an array passed to it. The array should be passed as a buttons prop and the default format is: [{label: "insert buttons label", onClick: "insert an onClick function"}].
It supports one other toggleLabel prop, for the toggle button that collapses and expands the drop down. See the code itself for an example of what a basic implementation would look like.
